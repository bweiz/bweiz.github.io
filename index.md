## Featured Projects

### Security Dashcam (Raspberry Pi 5, Multi-Camera Video Pipeline)
A multi-camera dashcam system focused on reliable recording + optional live streaming, with motion-triggered behavior and a full processing mode pipeline.
- Multi-input capture (MIPI + USB), stitching/encode pipeline
- Motion detection as a trigger/keep-recording mechanism
- Designed for real-world constraints (latency/bitrate/power)

Repo: https://github.com/bweiz/Security-Dash-Camera  
Docs: /projects.md#security-dashcam

### FPGA + Embedded Linux (DE10-Nano / RTL + Drivers)
Hardware/software co-design projects: custom RTL blocks, memory-mapped control, and Linux user-space / driver interfacing.
- RTL modules (PWM/control, register interfaces)
- Linux-side control (sysfs/misc device patterns, scripts/tools)
- Emphasis on testability + clear documentation

### MSP430 Options Deviation Visualizer
Microcontroller project combining inputs (keypad/encoder/pot) with real-time pricing math and visual feedback.
- User input → compute → display/LED feedback loop
- Emphasis on UI flow, reliability, and embedded constraints

Docs: /projects.md#msp430-options-visualizer

## What I’m good at
- Embedded Linux (Raspberry Pi / SBC workflows), Python tooling, bash, Git
- Digital design + FPGA workflows (RTL, memory-mapped peripherals, HW/SW integration)
- Video systems thinking: capture → process → encode → stream/store
